VS Code was great until it wasn't. Zed is:

- **Stupid fast** - Native performance, no Electron lag
- **AI-native** - Copilot integration that doesn't feel bolted on
- **Vim motions** - Finally, a GUI editor that respects my muscle memory

The only thing I miss is the extension ecosystem. But honestly? I didn't use 90% of those extensions anyway.
