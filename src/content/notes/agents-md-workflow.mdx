I've been using AI coding assistants more and more, and the biggest problem I kept running into was inconsistency. One day it writes clean code with proper error handling, the next day it's spaghetti. So I wrote a rulebook.

My [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/isala404/dotfiles/blob/main/workflows/base/AGENTS.md) is basically a behavior contract for AI agents. It defines how they should plan, implement, and deliver code changes across all my projects.

## The Core Idea

The agent maintains two persistent files:

- **PROGRESS.md** - tracks completed tasks with file changes and flags
- **MEMORIES.md** - stores stack info, coding preferences, patterns, and domain context

Every task follows a three-phase workflow:

1. **Planning** - read memory, clarify scope, scan codebase, create a PLAN.md, seek approval before touching anything
2. **Execution** - implement step-by-step with verification, make surgical changes only
3. **Finalization** - get approval, update tracking files, delete PLAN.md, suggest commit message

## The Coding Principles

I extracted 12 universal rules that apply regardless of language or framework:

- Design for unit testability through dependency injection
- Write idiomatic code leveraging language features
- Favor simplicity over cleverness (call it "Linus's good taste")
- Single responsibility per function/class
- Fail fast with explicit validation
- Keep code short, immutable by default
- Structured logging with context, not string interpolation

## Why This Matters

It's about consistency and predictability. The agent operates as a disciplined developer, not a code generator. No more god objects, no more premature abstractions, no more untestable mess.
