In this article, I discuss Linux eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) and its various capabilities that significantly enhance observability within Kubernetes.

## What is eBPF?

eBPF is a revolutionary technology that allows programs to run in the Linux kernel without changing kernel source code or loading kernel modules. This provides unprecedented visibility into system behavior.

## Why eBPF for Observability?

Traditional observability approaches require instrumenting applications with SDKs or agents. eBPF changes this by:

- **Zero instrumentation** - Observe any application without code changes
- **Low overhead** - Kernel-level efficiency
- **Universal visibility** - Works with any programming language
- **Deep insights** - Access to kernel-level metrics

## Building an eBPF-based Observability Stack

The key components you'll need:

1. **Pixie** - Auto-instrumented observability for Kubernetes
2. **Cilium** - eBPF-based networking and security
3. **bpftrace** - High-level tracing language

## Conclusion

eBPF represents a paradigm shift in how we approach observability. By moving data collection to the kernel level, we achieve unprecedented visibility with minimal overhead.
